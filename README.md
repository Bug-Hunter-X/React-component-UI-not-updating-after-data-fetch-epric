# React Component UI Update Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React applications where the UI fails to update after fetching data from an API. The `MyComponent` fetches data, but the changes are not reflected in the UI. 

## Problem Description

The `bug.js` file contains a React component that fetches data from an API using `fetch`. While the data is fetched successfully, the UI remains unchanged. This is likely because of a missing key prop, improper state management or a similar issue related to React's reconciliation process.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to the problem. The solution addresses the root cause by adding missing key prop or making changes to the state management logic.
